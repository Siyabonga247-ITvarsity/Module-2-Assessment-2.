        <br>
        <p>SHELTER is the story of a former assassin's bond with a young girl. Michael Mason (Jason Statham) lives alone on an island in the Outer Hebrides off Scotland, along with his unnamed pet dog. A middle-aged man arrives every week on the island, along with his niece Jessie (Bodhi Rae Breathnach), and drops supplies. Michael doesn't even acknowledge them or open the door. One day, Jessie makes her displeasure clear about it, but Michael doesn't react. While returning, their boat capsizes. Michael runs to save them. The uncle dies while Jessie survives. She's injured and with no other option, Michael rushes to the mainland to buy medical supplies. Meanwhile, the MI6 is under scanner for developing 'Total Human Engagement Analytics' aka THEA, a programme capable of tracking anyone anywhere in the world but which also breaches privacy laws. As luck would have it, Michael is picked up by THEA, and it rings an alert in their system. Shockingly, due to mischief by vested interests, Michael is misidentified as a European terrorist, Timur Tschermov. A team is immediately sent by MI6 to eliminate 'Timur'. By the time the authorities realize their folly, it's too late, as Michael has already finished off the officers and is on the run along with Jessie. What happens next forms the rest of the film.</p>
